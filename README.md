There is a small chance that few features will not work well in browser, 
in that case we are recommended to run it local.

## If you want to run the project local
Run the script  `git clone https://github.com/YahelJac/whatsapp-web-client.git`

Go to directory `cd whatsapp-web-client`

In the project directory, you need the install dependencies by run: `npm install`

Then start by:`npm start`
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
